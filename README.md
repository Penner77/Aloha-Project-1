# Aloha Apparel

The Aloha Apparel static webpage was a first foray into the world of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Given a mock-up of the site at varying sizes, I was tasked with creating a "mobile first" and "responsive" website sizing from mobile to desktop (with a max width of 1240px).

## Technical Elements

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flickity, Git/GitHub, Terminal (Mac), non-stop coffee and elbow grease were all used in the creation of this website. Ensuring the languages, code and plug-ins worked well together was a struggle but a true learning experience.

Aspects used to create this website:
HTML
CSS
Flickity
Git/GitHub
Terminal
Elements and attributes
Doctypes, meta tags and comments
Structure of a webpage knowledge
Form elements
The box model
Classes and IDs
Color and backgrounds
CSS "reset"
Icon Fonts
Developer tools
Responsive Web Design
Mobile-first
CSS3 properties
Flexbox
JavaScript
Operators and Control Flow
Functions

## Personal Learning Curve

Learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript while making this website in real-time was an adventure! The basic templates of the design were difficult to get set up, let alone modifying them with unique identifiers that are custom to each scripting language. Sometimes a fix is as simple as a missing semi-colon, but most often it was just the real struggle of understanding how one data entry impacts the entire layout.

## Hanging Thoughts ### aka still-to-do-list

This project took on a personality of it's own and there are some things I will certainly be re-visiting soon in my own time:
JavaScript: I currently struggle with this language and look forward to coming back to it on this project. The Submit button is my white whale.
Flex-Box: though I can see it's great potential, I feel I wasn't able to fully take advantage of the flex properties. I look forward to clarifying it's tools and refreshing the site with my newfound knowledge and understanding of this powerful tool.
Messy Code: I'll be the first to admit I likely have a multitude of duplicated code that I will need more time to go through and clean out. This reflects back to my previous comment about Flex-Box and being uncertain exactly what commands are controlling what elements of the page.

## Acknowledgments

Not only did I have piles of help from Google, I would not have been able to get over some major hurdles without the help of my cohort members, specifically Lovely, Andrew, Vera and Tenzin.
